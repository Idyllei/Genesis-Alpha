What is NPCPlayer.lua?

     NPCPlayer.lua is the core of the NPC Players. They are designed to be an extension
of the `Player' class. NPCPlayer is used heavily in "Genesis" code.

SETUP:

    To set up NPCPlayer for use in your code, put this at the top of your script:

    >  local NPCPlayer,NPCPoints=unpack(require("NPCPlayer"));

    This will load the NPCPlayer class and the points used to traverse their paths
into your global _ENV.
